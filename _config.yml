    description: I spent a summer designing optomechanical and structural aspects of CHaS (the Circumgalactic Hydrogen Alpha Integral Field Unit Spectrograph) to be used at the MDM Observatory, for Prof. Schiminovich, PI for CHaS, Fireball, and Co-Investigator for the GALEX NASA Mission. I specifically focused on optomechanical component integration and design of the carbon truss structure, performing finite-element-analysis along the way for structural optimization.

    image_url: https://derekwacks.github.io/flir.jpg
    description: While residing on the homey 9th floor of Mudd... I designed a temperature control system with deadban heating & cooling functionality for a lithium cell test environment; experimented with Partial Integral Derivative algorithms for temperature control systems; researched & tinkered with remote Keithley instrument control (MQTT server using Mosquitto, nodeforwarder, WebREPL); and wrote code aiding graduate student research. The PI, Dan Steingart was in fact the faculty advisor at Princeton who signed off on electric boat motor R&D (see below) in the MAE department’s thermo lab. I don’t know if saying that gets Dan into trouble, but he has since come to Columbia anyways

    description: In 2016 I co-founded a startup that builds fully electric boat motors. From a lab bench in Princeton's thermo lab, Flux Marine is now closing a round of funding.

    description: Still in an early development stage, Tempus.Think is a SaaS time management project that evolves our perception of passing time away from the 24 hour clock and standard work week. By adapting how we allocate time, Tempus.Think allows us to live more thoughtful and productive lives.

    description: I had a brief stint welding metal sculptures from recycled steel. Inspirations ranged from Binary Search Trees to breakfast and the state of the world. I also wrote a novel (currently unpublished), "(Unauthentic) Smokey Hallow", about the escapades of an art dealer in New York and his trip across America. Needless to say, ridiculousness unfolds. I've also dabbled in poetry and electronic music composition using Logic, Reason and Pro Tools (though I buried any creations deep in the caverns of Sound Cloud, hopefully never to be found).

    description: I'm also an avid skier, coaching for a few seasons for the Olympic Regional Development Authority at Gore Mtn. in the Adirondacks and racing for Columbia in the USCSA. I've found causing mayhem in glades around the North-East keeps me from pulling my hair out when my code won't run. My licence plate reads "SHREDGNR". References available upon request.

  - name: Graduate school and Beyond
    description: My dream is to study consciousness through the lens of cognitive and computational neuroscience. I am obsessed with the emergent property of conscious thought (derived from assembling enough complex neural circuitry?), philosophical ramifications of this, and consequently how we can reverse-engineer this to build better computers (which in turn will THEN help us better understand the brain on a more intimate level). The end goal is to work in neural engineering to integrate brain machine interfaces into the human body to alter how we percieve reality. There's alot to think about
